## **PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**
**This is a personal project done for fun and to develop a platform where you can retrieve a principle from the book "How to Win Friends and Influence People" once a week, to put the book's principles into practice every day.**

*This project is simply a public web interface where it's possible to retrieve a single principle with some little Notions once a week.*

The platform **contains all the Principles from the book** *and some notions* that refer to the principles.

*The platform automatically changes the principle **every Monday**, with another one chosen randomly.*
